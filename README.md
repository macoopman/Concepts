# Concepts

This repo is going to be my new home for all the notes and learned lesson from working as a software developer and other personal worm holes that I should jump into.



## READING LIST

Below are all the books that I have read, are reading, or have read since starting this repo. 

The **In Progress** section is set up as a stack. The intent is to go down rabit holes as I see fit with the end goal of comming back to the orginal book
