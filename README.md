# Concepts

This repo is going to be my new home for all the notes and learned lesson from working as a software developer and other personal worm holes that I should jump into.



## Study LIST

Below are all the books that I have read, are reading, or have read since starting this repo. 

The **In Progress** section is set up as a stack. The intent is to go down rabit holes as I see fit with the end goal of comming back to the orginal book

### Current Reading List 
* I have a huge love of reading, but I find that I easily find myself drifting to new topics as I get deeper into longer technical books. There is just so much I want to read and learn. So my plan over then next bit of time is to try reading multiple books at the same time. I have some ideas about maintain balance of topics and lenth of time to commit to one book before switching, but at first I'm going to start with a pile I have at home and start with switching every chapter or so.
