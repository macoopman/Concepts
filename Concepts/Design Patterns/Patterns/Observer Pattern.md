# Observer Pattern

In the **observer pattern** there are two entities: the publisher i.e. **SUBJECT**  and the subscriber i.e. **OBSERVER**

### Subject
* The subject manages the data and notifies the Observers when data changes.


### Observer
* Observers **subscribe** (register) with the Subject to recievve updates when the data changes
